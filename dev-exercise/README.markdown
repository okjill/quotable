## A simple Vue.js app

**Goal**

The app only needs to support modern web browsers.

 * *Required:* Provide client-side pagination (up to 15 quotes per page).
 * *Required:* Provide a way to filter between game and movie quotes.
 * *Required:* Provide a client-side search that filters by the quote text.
